Simple Scripts and tools 

## ADHD Reboot
Hyperfocus leaves me overworking, or stuck on tasks when I need to stop.
Launch the powershell script, via the batch file.

It will either Lock, or Reboot your PC. 
There's an array of simple buttons for options.
And a checkbox for choosing lock, or reboot.

Lock leaves a dialogue open, with a timestamp of when it was locked.
